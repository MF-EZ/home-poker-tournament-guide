# Home Poker Tournament Guide

This repository is a simple, practical guide for running smooth and fun **home poker tournaments**.  
It covers basic setup decisions, blind structures, and tools that make managing a tournament easier without overcomplicating things.

This is aimed at casual and home games — not casino-level tournament operations.

## 1. Basic Tournament Setup

Before starting, decide on a few fundamentals:

- Number of players
- Buy-in amount
- Starting chip stacks
- Rebuy or freezeout format
- Payout structure (top 2–3 spots is common)

Keeping these decisions simple helps the game run smoothly.

## 2. Blind Structure Tips

A good blind structure keeps the game moving without rushing players.

General guidelines:
- Increase blinds every **10–20 minutes**
- Early levels should feel slow enough for play
- Later levels should naturally force action

Example (for a casual home game):

- 25 / 50  
- 50 / 100  
- 100 / 200  
- 200 / 400  
- 400 / 800  

Adjust timing and levels based on how long you want the tournament to last.

## 3. Managing the Tournament

The most common challenges during home tournaments are:
- Forgetting to raise blinds
- Losing track of levels
- Interrupting play to manage timing

Using a simple, dedicated timer helps avoid these issues.

For blind timers and basic tournament management, I use **Chip Challenger**  
👉 https://www.chipchallenger.com  

It’s a **free, browser-based poker tournament manager** that works without registration and includes optional Pro features for advanced users.

## 4. Keeping Games Fun and Fair

Some small tips that improve the experience:
- Announce blind changes clearly
- Keep chip denominations clean
- Set house rules before the first hand
- Avoid changing structures mid-tournament

Consistency matters more than complexity.

## 5. Optional Enhancements

If you want to go further:
- Add scheduled breaks
- Display blinds on a shared screen
- Track basic stats for fun (not required)

None of this is necessary — the goal is smooth gameplay.

## Final Notes

Home poker tournaments work best when setup is simple and distractions are minimized.  
Clear blind levels and a reliable timer go a long way toward making the game enjoyable for everyone.

Feel free to adapt this guide to match your group and playing style.
